git init #initializing local folder for accessing github repo that will come next
git remote add origin <link for your github repository> #linking to certain repo on your github account
git add . #Saves all file to staging git add <filename>
git status #tells what files are in local repo which are changed which are in staging phase 
git commit -m "message" #commits the files changed to local repo (still not transferred to remote repo)
git push origin main #pushes the files to remote repo on default branch

before working on open source or someone else's repository first youll have to fork it to your own github account
then you can clone it to local repo then work on it and add, commit, push to staging, local repo, remote repo(own)
Now you have to send it from your own forked repo to the main their account repository so you'll do pull request.

git init is always used.
git clone <url> #to clone the files of remote repo to local repo

git fetch # fetches the changes in a certain file on which more than one person are working on
git pull # pulls the changes from remote repo and directly changes them to local repo
